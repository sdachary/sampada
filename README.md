## What is Sampada?

Sampada is a **standalone, self-hosted personal finance OS** that takes you from **debt → zero → wealth** in a defined timeline.

Most finance apps are either budgeting tools or investment dashboards. Sampada is the full arc:

```
Negative  →  Zero  →  Positive
(in debt)    (free)    (wealthy)
```

The app follows one rule: **clear your liabilities before building wealth.** It doesn't block you — but it always shows debt freedom progress front and center, and investment suggestions only strengthen once debt is under control.

**What makes Sampada different:**
1. **Philosophy-first** — "Debt first, then wealth" isn't a feature, it's the foundation
2. **Your data stays yours** — self-hosted, no surveillance capitalism
3. **Free AI from day one** — no $20/month for AI features
4. **Multi-currency from day one** — 32 currencies, auto-exchange rates, global market support
5. **Built for India** — NSE/BSE, EMIs, SIPs, ₹ currency
6. **Community-driven** — features serve users, not shareholders
7. **Standalone Architecture** — No external dependencies, all data stays local

## The Journey

### Phase 1 — Debt Freedom
List all loans and EMIs. Sampada suggests payoff order (avalanche = highest interest first, snowball = smallest balance first). Tracks monthly progress and projects your debt-free date.

### Phase 2 — Foundation Building
Once debt is healthy, SIP suggestions activate. You set a monthly contribution — even ₹500 works. AI picks 2–3 dividend stocks aligned with your timeline and goals.

### Phase 3 — Income Target
You define the goal: *"₹25,000/month passive income by 2030."* Sampada reverse-engineers the path — what SIP amount, which stocks, when to rebalance — and checks in monthly.
